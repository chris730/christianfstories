		<h1>The 15:36 to Norfolk</h1>
		<p>As Thomas walks towards the main entrance of London Euston, Thomas is filled with excitement, he has been looking forward to this trip for weeks. Thomas hasn’t seen his wife and son, who lived in Norfolk, in months due to his work. He had finally been able to secure a seat on the 15:36 train to Norfolk, the final service for the year before the tracks would be closed due to the forecasted snowstorm.</br>

As he waited at London Euston station, he sent a telegram to his family, his heart overflowing with excitement at the thought of finally being reunited with them.</br>
"I'll be home soon my loves, I cannot wait to see you and Michael," he had written, a wide smile spreading across his face as he sent the message.</br>
</br>
As he boarded the train and made his way to his first class berth, Thomas couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. He had missed his family more than words could express, and he was eager to spend the holiday season with them. However, unforeseen weather conditions had caused snow to build up on tracks leaving the city, causing the train to depart Euston an hour late. The conductor made an announcement, informing the passengers of certain safety features and regulations they should adhere to, and telling them that the train would be arriving in Norfolk in about 16 hours, with a few stops along the way to refuel and to pick up passengers.</br>
</br>
As the train made its way through rural England, the snow outside became increasingly rough and treacherous. Thomas couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as he watched the snow-covered landscape pass by his window. He knew that the weather forecast had called for a major snowstorm, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something was going to go wrong.</br>
</br>
As the train passed through the Great Rocky Mountains, the staff began beverage service to the passengers, with the smell of warm coffee filling the carriage. Thomas enjoyed a cup of warm tea, complemented with a warm jam filled scone. </br>
</br>
Suddenly, chaos erupted as the brakes on the train suddenly engaged, causing people who were standing to fall down and spilling beverages all over the place.</br>
</br>
Through the window, Thomas could see snow crashing down the mountains in the distance, heading straight towards the track. It became very clear to Thomas what was happening, and he hastily rushed to his berth.</br>
</br>
An announcement was broadcasted urgently, instructing the passengers to return to their seats. Thomas could feel the panic rising in his chest as he made his way back to his seat, his heart pounding in his ears.</br>
</br>
And then, with a loud crash, the locomotive and the first coach were heavily damaged as they crashed into a pile of snow that had fallen onto the tracks. There were many injured people, and Thomas could hear the cries and screams of his fellow passengers all around him. He made his way to the dining car, where he found a group of people huddled together, trying to stay warm. The staff was frantically trying to shove anything they could find - table cloths, napkins, spare uniforms - into the vents and gaps in the walls to try and keep the cold out. People were given blankets and warm water.</br>
</br>
The train was stranded, with no hope for help. Thomas stared at what was unfolding in front of him blankly, he couldn't believe what was happening. He had been looking forward to this trip for so long, and now it seemed like everything was falling apart.</br>

As the hours ticked by, the situation only seemed to get worse. The cold was seeping into the coaches, and many of the passengers were starting to succumb to hypothermia. Thomas couldn't shake the feeling of despair that was settling in his chest. He knew that he had to do something, but he didn't know what. It was then that he met Luke, who Thomas finds out is a single man who had lost his child to influenza. Despite the wound on his head and the fact that he was clearly in pain, Luke retained his ambitious personality and struck up a conversation with Thomas. As they talked, Thomas couldn't help but feel drawn to the man's strength and determination in the face of such adversity.</br>
</br>
Hours passed, and Thomas could feel that Luke was getting tired, his speech slow and without that enthusiasm. Luke’s head began to rest on Thomas's shoulder, and Thomas watched as Luke's lips turned purple, a sign of the impending danger of hypothermia. He shook the man, trying to rouse him, but there was no response. Thomas knew the man’s death was inevitable, and despite not knowing much about the stranger, Thomas felt a connection to Luke, making him emotional for his loss. Thomas looked around and saw that many of the other passengers were in the same state, their lips purple as they lay on the floor, shivering their eyes shut.</br>
</br>
Thomas couldn't believe what was happening. He had been so looking forward to this trip, to seeing his family and celebrating the holiday season with them, finally being able to see his son again.And now, it seemed like everything was lost.</br>
</br>
As the cold overtook him and his consciousness started to fade, Thomas couldn't help but think about his family, waiting for him in Norfolk. He closed his eyes and let out a soft sigh, praying that somehow, he would find a way to make it home to them.</br>
</br>
In his mind's eye, he could see his wife's warm smile and the sparkle in his son’s eyes as they greeted him at the door. He could hear the sound of his son's laughter as they played together in the living room, building gingerbread houses and decorating the Christmas tree. But as the cold overtook him and everything faded to black, Thomas knew that he would never get the chance to see his family again. He had given everything he had to try and survive, but in the end, it was not enough. He closed his eyes for the final time, his thoughts filled with love and regret as he slipped away into the darkness. And as the train and all of its passengers weakened and helpless, stranded in the snowy wilderness with no hope of rescue, Thomas knew that he would always be remembered as a devoted husband and father, who had given everything in his quest to be reunited with those he loved.</br>
</br>

</br>
It had been a week since the accident, and the news was filled with reports of the tragic train crash that had claimed the lives of so many people. Thomas's wife sat in their living room, staring at the radio in shock and disbelief as she listened to the latest updates. Their son, Michael, sat quietly by her side, tears streaming down his face as he listened to the news.
"The rescue team from Shirebrook, where the train was meant to refuel but never showed up, found no survivors," the news reporter's voice filled the room, causing Thomas's wife to let out a sob. "The track between Norfolk and London has been shut down in both directions as authorities continue to investigate the cause of the accident."</br>
</br>
The reporter’s voice faded as the reality of the situation hit them, both Thomas's wife and son couldn't hold back their tears any longer. They had been waiting for Thomas to come home for the holiday season, and now it seemed like he was gone forever. They sat in the living room, surrounded by the remnants of the Christmas celebrations they had planned. The tree was still up, the decorations twinkling in the darkness, but the joy and excitement of the holiday season had been completely overshadowed by the tragedy that had befallen their family. As they sat there, lost in their grief, Thomas's wife and son couldn't help but wonder what might have been. They had always known that life was fragile, but they had never imagined that they would lose Thomas in such a sudden and tragic way. But even as they struggled to come to terms with the loss, Thomas's wife and son knew that they had to be strong for each other. They had to find a way to carry on, to find hope in the midst of such darkness. And as they sat in the living room, surrounded by the memories of Thomas, they knew that they would always carry his love with them, no matter what life had in store for them.
